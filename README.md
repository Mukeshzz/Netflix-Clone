# Netflix Clone Project

This project is a simple Netflix clone created using HTML and CSS. It is designed to mimic the basic appearance of the Netflix interface without implementing responsiveness.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the Netflix clone.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the Netflix clone.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-clone.git
